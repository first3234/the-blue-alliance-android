[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android)

An Android app for accessing information about the FIRST Robotics Competition. This is a native mobile version of [The Blue Alliance](http://www.thebluealliance.com).

The app has been released to the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thebluealliance.androidclient&hl=en)! We also have a [beta tester community](https://plus.google.com/communities/108444518980185742549) that you can join to try some of the latest and greatest features without having to build the app yourself. Just rememver, there may still be issues. If you find any, please report them on the issue tracker so we can fix them.

Environment Setup
-----------------

1. Ensure that you have git installed and that it is added to your system's PATH variable. You should be open you system's shell, navigate to a git repository (like this one), run ```git status``` and get data back.
2. If you haven't already, make sure you have the Android development environment set up. You will need to have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) installed (this also required the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)).
3. Make sure you read through some [Tips and Tricks](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-tips.html) for developing with Android Studio. 
4. Use the [Android SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html) to download the correct versions of the Android libraries. You will need to download the Android SDK Tools, Android SDK Platform-Tools, and the SDK Platform for Android version 4.4 (API level 19). If you have already downloaded these, double check and make sure they've been updated to the latest version.
5. If you have an Android device you want to test on, make sure that you have [enabled USB Debugging](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16707137/how-to-find-and-turn-on-usb-debugging-mode-on-nexus-4) in your Settings menu. Otherwise, [configure a Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds.html) to debug with (you will have to also download the ARM System image from the SDK manager to use a virtual device).
