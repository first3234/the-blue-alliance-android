<b>OPR</b> (Offensive Power Rating) is very roughly 1/3 of a team's average alliance scores. It estimates the team's contribution to their alliance match scores, assuming team contributions are independent and ignoring opposing team contributions. Higher is better.

<b>DPR</b> (Defensive Power Rating) is very roughly 1/3 of a team's average opposing alliance scores. It estimates the team's contribution to opposing alliance match scores, assuming team contributions are independent and ignoring the opposing teams' own contributions. Lower is better.

<b>CCWM</b> (Calculated Contribution to Win Margin) = OPR - DPR. A team's expected net contribution to an alliance.

These stats are an interesting way to slice the data for teams at a particular event, but aren't a perfect system for assessing a team's performance or contribution.
